</header>
<ul>
  <li>Hello, everyone. My name is Vincent. I am a senior at CSUF. Once I finish this class,
    I will have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
    My hobbies include golfing, playing video games, and anything to do with baseball.
    I host a podcast with my friend called Freeway Feuds. My friend is a Dodger fan and I am
    an Angel fan so we discuss each team and debate which team is better. It's really fun.
